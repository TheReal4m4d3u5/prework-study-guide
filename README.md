# <Avery's Prework Study Guide>

## Description

    This project executes developer practices and habits in creating an application with accompanied relevant documentation. It is my motivation that I want to improve my skills as a developer so that I can expand my professional skills. And in building this project I can learn best practices and optimize my skills as a professional while understanding new 
    developer tools such as html, css, javascript and github. This project creates a web page for notes and allows the public to see those notes. In the developer tools console it also randomly chooses a subject to study. 
    
    In doing this project I have learned how to think like a developer and practice developer habits by learning how to set up a web development project and how to track my changes and development in a version tracking tool. I followed a process of creating and closing issues in github and creating documentation for my application. There were a number of tech stacks that were used in this project such as html-HTML, CSS and Javascript. Github was used for the version control tool which has all the branch repositories, open and closed issues, and logs to saved changes. It also includes a professional readme, showing installation of my app, how to use it, license, features, how to contribute and how to test the application.  

    Throught this project I learned professional practices and habits, new technologies and how to deploy my app and made app live on the internet for everyone to see and contribute to.
